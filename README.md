# Coronavirus (Covid-19) graphs
Reproducible graphs using publicly available data from the NYT and JHU.

## Graphs
The 10 countries / states with the most cases are selected to be put in the daily graphs. Only the days since the 10th death are shown for each country to remove some of the tail and make the graph more informative. This may be increased in the future as totals increase. 

### Log Scales
Logarithmic (log) scales are used to aid the human eye when discerning exponential growth. On linear scales it is hard to determine if exponential growth is continuing, accelerating, or decelerating. On a log scale exponential growth will appear as a line. This means if the growth rate changes it will be much more clear to the human eye than it would be on a linear scale.
